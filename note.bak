What is ML?
- machine: computers perform task: - learning by programming
machine to be like human, to decide 

AI includes ML includes Deep learning (type of algo ML)
Data science: analyzing data 

How ML works
- provide data (Inputs)
- create modele

why modele not have good accurate?
- tsy ampy ny data Inputs


NoSQL unstructured database: mongoDB 

ampiasana ny ML
business decisions 

Framework
1- collect data
2- data modeling
-> pb identification -> data -> evaluation -> features -> modeling -> experimentation
3- deploiment 

ML category: supervised - unsupervised - reinforcment

step1 pb identification: supervised or unsupervised or classification or regression ..
    supervised: 
    => classification ( binary , multiple ), predict class
    => regression, predict number
    unsupervised: data no labels 
    => clustering ( you provide the labels for the similar data)
    transfer learning:
    reiforcment learning:
step2 data: structured data rows column, unstructured data like images voices ...
step3 evaluation: what success waitted ?
    use metrics: 
    => classification: Accuracy , Precision,
    => regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE
step4 features: what we know about data?
step5 modeling: what modele should use? 
    choosing model : train 
        => structured data: catboost & XGBoost
        => unstructured: deep learning
    tuning model    : validation data
        => Adjust and modif hyperparameters of models
    model comparison : test data
        => underfitting: perf trainning >> perf test
        => overfitting: perf trainning << perf test
        solve under or over fitting: 
            => increase hyperparameters, try more advanced model, reduce amount of features..
step6 experimentation: how could improve result?

Data preparation: pandas ta

- ema14
- rsi 
- %daily ( output) => price prediction 
model => time series => regression
